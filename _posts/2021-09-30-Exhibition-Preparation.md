Key Words:
A relaxing place.
Has good privacy.
Have good lighting conditions.
Integrate the hobbies and characteristics of households.
Multi-level utilization of space.
Diversified single-living houses.
In my opinion, “home” should be a place where people can feel at home and relax. After working outside for a day, people who return home can take off their social masks and do what they want to do naturally. Especially on the basis of increasing social pressure, it is very important to have a place where you can relax completely. So on the basis of comfort, the home should have enough privacy to make people feel safe. But having privacy does not mean that you are completely separated from the outside world with a high wall. A good home has both privacy and good communication with the outside world. I think this kind of communication mainly lies in the good communication of light inside and outside the house. The sense of belonging that home can bring is also very important. When people return home, they can realize that this is their own territory and have traces of their own lives. Therefore, I think the home should not be a repetitive model room. The people who live in it should incorporate their own unique consciousness and hobbies into it. Privacy and sense of belonging are my definition of home. So I named the title: “Home”, secret garden only belongs to you .

It is obvious that my definition of home does not apply to everyone. I define the "Clients of my design" as: Young people who are undergoing advanced studies or have graduated and are participating in work; usually live alone, occasionally have friends or objects temporarily live, and do not raise or keep a pet. For this type of people, the home does not need to be big, only a place to meet the needs of relaxation.

### Site
The type of site I want to choose is a standalone site - very small residual site for a single, standalone residence.For example, the lawn in Liberty Park.There are other residents around this park, which is a suitable place to live. There are bus stops around the park, which is convenient for residents to travel. It also has sports fields and swimming pools for leisure, which is a good location to build mini villas.

### Material
The materials I choose are timbercrete, wood and glass. The materials are cheaper and lighter. It is a good material to save time and money.

### Technology Application
I have investigated the climate of Salt Lake City and can be summarized as: little precipitation, high sunshine, cold and humid winter, little sunshine, hot summer, and large temperature difference between day and night.

So I decided to start from two aspects, water collection and indoor and outdoor air exchange. I searched the Internet and decided to use the simplest cross ventilation to solve the problem of air exchange. Cross ventilation refers to a form of ventilation that occurs naturally in buildings. The basic requirement of this kind of ventilation is that there must be an air inlet and an outlet, and the pressure of the air entering the space must be different from the pressure of the air leaving. In the simplest terms, this pressure difference occurs when two windows in a room are open and facing different directions. Salt Lake City has a large temperature difference between day and night, and temperature changes will directly affect the indoor and outdoor air pressure. There is a glass courtyard in the house I designed. As long as the remaining window positions are designed reasonably, good ventilation can be achieved without too much. The water collection system is more complicated. Generally speaking, the recovered rainwater is not for drinking, but is used to meet daily needs such as watering plants, cleaning housework, and washing toilets. The water quality requirements are not high, so only the basic filtration of rainwater is required to remove the main impurities. Can. Roofs and pipes can be used to collect rainwater, and more consideration is needed where to store water. I will use the sloped roof and walls of the designed house to complete water collection and storage.
