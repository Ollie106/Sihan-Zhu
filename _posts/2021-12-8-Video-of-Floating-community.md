The floating community is located in Buiten-IJ, Amsterdam, where the high-density city meets the open wilderness, surrounded by roads and bridges and part of the urban space. Inspired by the connection of hexagonal holes in corals, the building built a multifunctional water community with platforms composed of different hexagons. The project combines the surrounding environment and people's livelihood, and divides the community functions into: residential area, living area, working area, sales area, and biological area. The people in the residential area are water workers, so a large area of piers has been added to the community. In order to make use of the external mobility of the community, some houses will be used for leasing. The living area includes public space and other functional areas of the holy lake. The sales area is a place for community residents to sell aquatic products and interact with the surrounding cities. The biological area contains shellfish breeding areas and water bird habitats, and is the key to the community's ecological cycle.
