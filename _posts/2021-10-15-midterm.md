"Home-a secret garden only belongs to you ."

In my opinion, "home" should be a comfortable, free space of one's own. That is to have enough privacy, but also have enough light. Small houses should be flexible enough, not only indoors, but also outdoors. So my house is designed with the goal of comfort, showing and expanding the homeowner’s life hobbies. 

I define the “Clients of my design” as: Young people who are undergoing advanced studies or have graduated and are participating in work; usually live alone, occasionally have friends or objects temporarily live, and do not raise or keep a pet. For this type of people, the home does not need to be big, only a place to meet the needs of relaxation. “Home” should be a place where people can feel at home and relax. After working outside for a day, people who return home can take off their social masks and do what they want to do naturally. Especially on the basis of increasing social pressure, it is very important to have a place where you can relax completely. So on the basis of comfort, the home should have enough privacy to make people feel safe. But having privacy does not mean that you are completely separated from the outside world with a high wall. A good home has both privacy and good communication with the outside world. I think this kind of communication mainly lies in the good communication of light inside and outside the house. The sense of belonging that home can bring is also very important. When people return home, they can realize that this is their own territory and have traces of their own lives. Therefore, I think the home should not be a repetitive model room. The people who live in it should incorporate their own unique consciousness and hobbies into it. Privacy and sense of belonging are my definition of home. So I named the title: “Home”, secret garden only belongs to you .

The type of site I want to choose is a standalone site - very small residual site for a single, standalone residence. For example, the lawn in Liberty Park.There are other residents around this park, which is a suitable place to live. There are bus stops around the park, which is convenient for residents to travel. It also has sports fields and swimming pools for leisure, which is a good location to build mini villas.

I have investigated the climate of Salt Lake City and can be summarized as: little precipitation, high sunshine, cold and humid winter, little sunshine, hot summer, and large temperature difference between day and night. So I designed a simple water collection system for the house, using the inclined roof of the house to collect rainwater into the hollow pipe on the ground, perform simple filtration, and finally collect it in the bathroom. The collected level can be used for watering, cleaning, etc. The special feature of the house is that the glass room next to the bedroom can be sliding on rails, so this part of the space can be switched between inside and outside at the owner's will. It moves in a similar way to a drawer, but the handles that control it are inside. Inside, bookshelves move horizontally from east to west, providing ample space for study and recreation. At the same time, dining table and bookshelf are combined to make the interior space more flexible.
