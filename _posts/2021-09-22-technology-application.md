## Climate characteristics of Salt Lake City
I have investigated the climate of Salt Lake City and can be summarized as: little precipitation, high sunshine, cold and humid winter, little sunshine, hot summer, and large temperature difference between day and night.

So I decided to start from two aspects, water collection and indoor and outdoor air exchange.
I searched the Internet and decided to use the simplest cross ventilation to solve the problem of air exchange. Cross ventilation refers to a form of ventilation that occurs naturally in buildings. The basic requirement of this kind of ventilation is that there must be an air inlet and an outlet, and the pressure of the air entering the space must be different from the pressure of the air leaving. In the simplest terms, this pressure difference occurs when two windows in a room are open and facing different directions. Salt Lake City has a large temperature difference between day and night, and temperature changes will directly affect the indoor and outdoor air pressure. There is a glass courtyard in the house I designed. As long as the remaining window positions are designed reasonably, good ventilation can be achieved without too much.
The water collection system is more complicated. Generally speaking, the recovered rainwater is not for drinking, but is used to meet daily needs such as watering plants, cleaning housework, and washing toilets. The water quality requirements are not high, so only the basic filtration of rainwater is required to remove the main impurities. Can. Roofs and pipes can be used to collect rainwater, and more consideration is needed where to store water. I will use the sloped roof and walls of the designed house to complete water collection and storage.
