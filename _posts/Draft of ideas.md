## Indoor space division

I browsed a large number of small houses and got a certain idea of the space I designed. The residence has basic space: living room, bathroom, bedroom, kitchen, desk. In addition, there is an indoor greenhouse in the house, the walls of which are made of glass. The greenhouse exists to introduce a lot of natural light, facilitate the exchange of indoor and outdoor air, and adjust the indoor temperature. The most important thing for me is that this is a free space where the homeowner can raise pets, grow plants, or use it as a studio, studio, tea room, etc., to show their personal characteristics.
